The aim of this repository is to store all robotics concepts I have acquired from my experiences, courses, projects, etc ... 

**Note: Most explanations are very summarized, the goal here is to quickly refresh your mind when looking up a concept and 
emphasizing on the use cases, benefits and drawbacks.**
